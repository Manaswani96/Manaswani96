## 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm a curious blend of code and cosmos 
An **AI/ML enthusiast** with a heart wired for **quantum curiosity**.  
Part engineer, part philosopher, part explorer.

### 🧬 My Passions:
- Simulating intelligence (and sometimes understanding it).
- Bending classical limits with **quantum computing**.
- Studying the universe like Feynman would: by building, breaking, and believing.
- Turning chaos into clarity with clean code and well-crafted research.

## 🧲 Admiring Minds
- Feynman: Playful, precise, profoundly curious.
- Einstein: Dreaming with equations.
- Tesla: Inventing futures.
…then we're already friends in some entangled dimension.


If you're here to collaborate, discuss research, or build something meaningful, I'm all ears.
